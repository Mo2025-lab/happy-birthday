        <h1>Karen Escalante</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Today, a legend turns 27. Across the galaxy, celebrations erupt.</p>
      <p>From distant planets to nearby moons, everyone shouts...</p>
      <p>"Happy Birthday Karen!!!!</p>
      <p>Here’s to another year of bad decisions, great tans, smooth hits, and an alarming intake of chocolate — both the kind you eat and the kind that occasionally ruins your sleep schedule.</p>
      <p>"May your tequila stay cold, your weed stay loud, and your EDM drop harder than your ex’s self-esteem.</p>
      <p>Stay wild, stay toxic (in the fun way), and never apologize for chasing sun, bass, or beautiful brown men with questionable intentions. 💃🏽🍫🔥</p>
